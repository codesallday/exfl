[Create or renew your team here](https://yho.com/nfl?l=97636&k=31c44b29f185cbe4&ikey=f7f2d548cbeca328)

If you played last year and would like to lock in a keeper for 2015, $80 is due on or before Tuesday, July 28th. 
You must select your keeper no later than this date. On receipt of payment, you will be given a **tentative** draft spot based on a max of 16 teams.

* Keeper candidates are players that were on your team at the end of the regular season.
* If drafted, keeper will be pegged for that round.
* If picked up or traded for mid-season, keeper round is conditional based on the players current ADP on draft day.
* Draft slot is subject to change in the scenario where the league contains less than 16 teams by draft day.

[Rules Meeting is Tuesday July, 28th](https://www.facebook.com/events/502387323245101/)

Draft will happen roughly 2 weeks later on a weekday evening most likely at Extremez. Official date to come soon.
