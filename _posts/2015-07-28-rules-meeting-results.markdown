There wasn't a huge deviation with the new rules this year. Here are the results:

* There was some confusion about the last place penalty and it was re-decided the penalty should be 125% percent of the buy-in amount. This applies for both this year as well as going forward.
* It was also decided, in the case of exactly 14 teams, there should not be divisions. 14 is not as easily divisible like 12 and 16 are. Ditching divisions in this scenario also enables a team to play every other team exactly once.
* Waivers have been changed to the reverse order of in-season rankings. 
* Only 2 points will be awarded for field goals 19 yards or less.
* In order to protect against freak injuries or huge value adjustments, chosen keepers may be optionally forfeit anytime until the first pick at 6:30PM on 8/17.
